    In this series, we're building a multi-tenant organization system using Supabase and Next.js. Functionality includes:

    - Supabase authentication
    - Organization management
    - User invitations
    - Organization-wide permissions
    - App-wide permissions
    - Cross-domain authentication cookies
    - UI components for authentication, organization management, and more

In this first part, we'll hit the ground running with a quick project setup and implementing cross-domain authentication.

## Supabase project setup

First, let's create a new Supabase project.

I like to create a local project first using [Supabase CLI](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/local-development/cli/getting-started). For now we just want the default project with the default credentials. Use `supabase init` to create a new project. Then start the database using `supabase start` and copy the URL and anon key.

Or you can choose to start with a cloud project too by creating a new project at [supabase.com/dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard).

## Next.js project setup

### Option A: Quick Start

If you want to skip the Next.js project setup and Supabase connection, you can get a head start with the [Supabase Subdomain Cookies snippet](/docs/snippets/subdomain-cookies/installation). To do this, run the following command to create a new Next.js project.

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add https://snippets.thedevdavid.com/r/next-supabase-subdomain-cookies.json
```

This will set up a new Next.js project with shadcn/ui and Supabase authentication.

### Option B: Manual setup

If you want to setup the project manually, you'll need to create a new Next.js project, then install and configure the Supabase dependencies.

#### Step 1: Create a new Next.js project:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app --typescript --tailwind --app
cd my-app
```

#### Step 2: Install the Supabase dependencies:

```bash
npm install @supabase/ssr @supabase/supabase-js
```

#### Step 3: Configure the Supabase client:

Follow the official [Supabase server-side auth guide](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/server-side/nextjs) to setup the Supabase clients.

#### Step 4: Cross-domain cookies

One of the key features we need for a multi-tenant system is the ability to share authentication across subdomains. This means if a user logs in at `auth.yourdomain.com`, they should remain authenticated when navigating to `app.yourdomain.com` or `yourdomain.com`.

Add this to your `.env.local` file:

```bash
COOKIE_DOMAIN=.yourdomain.com # Note the leading dot!
```

Create a cookie configuration file `utils/supabase/auth-config.ts` and add the following:

```typescript title="utils/supabase/auth-config.ts"
import type { CookieOptionsWithName } from "@supabase/ssr";
import { DEFAULT_COOKIE_OPTIONS } from "@supabase/ssr";

export const COOKIE_OPTIONS: CookieOptionsWithName = {
  ...DEFAULT_COOKIE_OPTIONS,
  name: "auth_session",
  domain: process.env.COOKIE_DOMAIN ?? ".localhost",
  path: "/",
  maxAge: 60 * 60 * 24 * 365, // 1 year
  sameSite: "lax" as const,
};
```

Modify `utils/supabase/server.ts` and `utils/supabase/middleware.ts` to include the cookie options.

```typescript title="utils/supabase/middleware.ts and utils/supabase/server.ts"
return createServerClient(
    process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL!,
    process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY!,
    {
      cookieOptions: COOKIE_OPTIONS,
```

That's it for the project setup. In [part 2 we'll start the heavy lifting with the database schema](/blog/multitenant-supabase-part-2).

- Setting up the organization data model
- Implementing organization creation and management
- Handling user invitations and roles
- Creating organization-specific settings
