This is a collection of snippets I created while working on projects. I've decided to share them here in case they might be useful to someone else.

## Snippets

<Cards>
  <Card
    href="/docs/nextjs-supabase/snippets/subdomain-cookies/installation"
    title="Subdomain Cookies"
  >
    Share cookies between subdomains so authentication works across them
  </Card>
  <Card
    href="/docs/nextjs-supabase/snippets/organizations/installation"
    title="Organizations"
  >
    Create and manage organizations
  </Card>
</Cards>

## Components

<Cards>
  <Card href="/docs/nextjs-supabase/components/auth-card" title="Auth Card">
    A card that displays the user's avatar and name, and a button to sign out
  </Card>
</Cards>

## How to use them?

All snippets are distributed using shadcn registry, so you can install them with `npx shadcn@latest add <snippet>` or you can install them manually.

## How to contribute?

All snippets are open source, so you can contribute to them by opening a PR on [GitHub](https://github.com/thedevdavid/snippets).

## License

All snippets are licensed under the MIT license. See the [LICENSE](https://github.com/thedevdavid/snippets/blob/main/LICENSE) file for more details.

## Updates

I'll try to keep the snippets up to date with the latest version of the libraries. It may or may not happen quickly after new versions are released.

## Thanks

Thanks to [shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com) for providing a great registry for snippets.
